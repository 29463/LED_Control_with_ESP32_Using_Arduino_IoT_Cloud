Features of the System
1.	Arduino IoT Cloud Integration:
o	Use Arduino IoT Cloud for remote control and monitoring.
o	Secure communication via a Thing ID and a Device Secret.
2.	ESP32:
o	Acts as the microcontroller and connects to Wi-Fi.
o	Receives commands from the IoT Cloud to control the LED.
3.	LED:
o	Turns on/off based on user input from the IoT dashboard.

Arduino IoT Cloud Setup
1.	Create an Arduino IoT Cloud Account:
o	Sign in or create an account at Arduino IoT Cloud.
2.	Create a New Thing:
o	Go to Things > Create Thing.
o	Add a variable for the LED:
	Name: ledState
	Type: boolean
	Permission: Read & Write
	Update: On Change
3.	Configure the Device:
o	Add your ESP32 as a device.
o	Follow the setup steps, and Arduino IoT Cloud will generate a Thing ID and Device Secret.
4.	Dashboard Creation:
o	Go to Dashboards > Create Dashboard.
o	Add a toggle switch to control the ledState variable.

How It Works
1.	Cloud Integration:
o	ESP32 connects to Arduino IoT Cloud over Wi-Fi.
o	The cloud sends commands to update the ledState variable.
2.	LED Control:
o	The ESP32 monitors the ledState variable.
o	Based on the variable value, it turns the LED on or off.
Circuit Diagram
1.	Connect the anode (+) of the LED to GPIO5 on the ESP32 through a 220Ω resistor.
2.	Connect the cathode (-) of the LED to GND on the ESP32.
